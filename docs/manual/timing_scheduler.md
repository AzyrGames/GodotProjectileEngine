# Timing Scheduler
The Timing Scheduler module manages the timing and scheduling of events. It uses:
-   **[TimingScheduler Node](timing_scheduler_node.md)**: The main node responsible for scheduling events.
-   **[TimingSchedulerComponent](timing_scheduler_component.md)**: Components that define specific timing behaviors.
By combining these elements, you can create complex timing patterns for various game events.
## Child Components Documentation
- [TimingScheduler Node](timing_scheduler_node.md) - Main scheduler node
- [TimingSchedulerComponent](timing_scheduler_component.md) - Base for all timing components
- [Timing Scheduler Components](timing_scheduler_components.md) - Specific timing components
