# ProjectileSpeedAccelerate
The `ProjectileSpeedAccelerate` behavior applies constant acceleration to projectile speed. It extends the `ProjectileBehaviorSpeed` class and provides the following properties:
-   **acceleration_speed**: Acceleration rate in units per second squared (how quickly speed increases)
-   **max_speed**: Maximum speed the projectile can reach (in units per second)
